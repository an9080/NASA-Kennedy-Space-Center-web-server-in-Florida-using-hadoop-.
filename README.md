# Hadoop 

## Hadoop introduction:
Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.

## Dataset Description:
Typically, server logs are a very common data source in enterprises and log data comes from many sources in an enterprise, such as the web, client and compute servers, and applications. They can be used for monitoring servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems and much more. In this project, we will use log datasets from NASA Kennedy Space Center web server in Florida.
